To make this production-ready, you would need to:

-Connect the donation button to a real payment processor (like Stripe)

-Set up a backend API for the contact form

-Add CSRF protection

-Implement rate limiting

-Add more robust error handling

-Would you like me to:

-Explain any part of the code in more detail?

-Add any additional features?

-Help set up a payment processor integration?
